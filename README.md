# regression-using-tensorflow
This project demonstrates how to build a regression model using TensorFlow and Keras to predict continuous numeric values. It includes data preprocessing, constructing a neural network with dense layers, training the model using the Adam optimizer, and evaluating performance using metrics like Mean Squared Error (MSE)
